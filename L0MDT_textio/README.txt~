This directory contains two perl scripts to process VHDL sources with
user-defined types (records).

  make_textio.pl

    Read VHDL with type definitions, write textio package to
    support READ/WRITE as space-separated decimal numbers of each
    record element.

    Input is expected to come from the L0MDT standard data format
    scripts, so elements may only be defined as:

      std_logic               read/write as 0 or 1
      std_logic_vector(...)   read/write as signed decimal (32 bits max)
      <user_type>             user-defined type defined elsewhere in file

    Typical use:

      $ ./make_textio.pl l0mdt_buses_types_pkg.vhd l0mdt_buses_textio_pkg.vhd

      File l0mdt_buses_textio_pkg.vhd exists.  I'm about to over-write it
      with the textio library.  Is this OK (y/n)?y

      19 user types found

  make_report.pl

    Read two VHDL files:  type definitions, constants
    Output a simple text report with elements of each user-defined
    type.  Sample output:

    Note that the width of each std_logic_vector is determined by
    looking in the file of constants.

    Typical usage:

    $./make_report.pl l0mdt_buses_types_pkg.vhd l0mdt_buses_constants_pkg.vhd
